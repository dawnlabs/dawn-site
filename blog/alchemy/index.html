faq:
  - question: What problem does Alchemy solve?
    answer: >
      Alchemy makes image conversion and merging easy. Simply drag and drop your image files to seemlessly convert them into a variety of formats, or merge them into a <code>pdf</code> or <code>gif</code>.
      Other solutions force you to use clunky CLIs, cloud services that require internet, or expensive native apps.
      All of aforementioned options make you switch tabs/windows, which is a pain when dealing with files. With Alchemy,
      converting your files is always accessable in the Mac menubar.

  - question: What actions are supported?
    answer: >
      Currently, we only support a number of basic operations. For conversions, this includes <code>image</code> to <code>png</code>, <code>jpeg</code>, <code>bmp</code>, and <code>tiff</code>.
      We also support merging images into a <code>pdf</code> or <code>gif</code>.
      More abilities are coming soon! Send us an <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">issue/PR</a> for any requests/fixes.

  - question: How do you use the app?
    answer: >
      Simply open the app by clicking on the menubar icon, or by hitting <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>.
      Then just drag your image files into the application and select action options.
      We hope that's a bit easier than what you're used to.

  - question: What technology is it built with?
    answer: >
      Alchemy is built entirely on <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>, and uses
      <code>Imagemagick</code> under the hood. Right now we require that you have <code>Imagemagick</code> installed (this is soon to change!).
      We're using <code>Webpack</code> for builds, and
      <code>electron-packager</code> to package Alchemy for macOS.

  - question: Whats next?
    answer: >
      In short, quite a bit:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><strike>Install Imagemagick with Alchemy so you dont have to.<br></strike></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/4" target="_blank" class="a-smart">More output file types.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/5" target="_blank" class="a-smart">More input file types: video, code, <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">you tell us</a>!</a></li>
