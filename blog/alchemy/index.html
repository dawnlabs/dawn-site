faq:
  - question: What problem does Alchemy solve?
    answer: >
      <a class="a-smart" href="http://dawnlabs.io/alchemy">Alchemy</a> makes image conversion and merging easy.
      While existing options make you switch through multiple tabs/windows,
      Alchemy makes file conversion accessible directly in the Mac menubar.
      Other solutions also force you to use clunky CLIs, cloud services that
      require internet, or expensive native apps.
      With Alchemy, simply drag and drop your image files to seamlessly convert
      them into a variety of formats, or merge them into a <code>pdf</code>.

  - question: What actions are supported?
    answer: >
      Currently, Alchemy only supports a number of basic operations.
      This includes merging images into a <code>pdf</code>,
      and converting an <code>image</code> to <code>png</code>, or <code>jpg</code>.
      More abilities are coming soon! Send us an <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">issue/PR</a> for any requests/fixes.

  - question: How do you use the app?
    answer: >
      Simply open the app by clicking on the menubar icon, or by hitting <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>.
      Then just drag your image files into the application and select 'Merge' or 'Convert'.
      We hope that's a bit easier than what you're used to.

  - question: What technology is it built with?
    answer: >
      Alchemy is built entirely on <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>, and uses
      <a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/photosorcery" class="a-smart">photosorcery</a>, a lightweight <code>Golang</code> image
      manipulation library, under the hood.
      We're using <code>Webpack</code> for builds, and
      <code>electron-packager</code> to package Alchemy for macOS.

  - question: What's next?
    answer: >
      In short, quite a bit:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/4" target="_blank" class="a-smart">More output file types.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/5" target="_blank" class="a-smart">More input file types: video, code, <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">you tell us</a>!</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/6" target="_blank" class="a-smart">Smoother workflow, display a link to open in the finder.</a></li>
      </ul>
