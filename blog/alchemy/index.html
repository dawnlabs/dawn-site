faq:
  - question: What does Alchemy solve?
    answer: >
      <a href="https://dawnlabs.github.io/alchemy" target="_blank" class="a-smart">Alchemy</a>
      makes sure converting your files is never too far away.
      Other solutions force you to use clunky CLIs, cloud services that require internet, or expensive native apps.
      All of these options also make you switch tabs, which can be a pain when you are dealing with files. With Alchemy,
      converting your files is always accessable in the Mac menubar.

  - question: What conversions are supported?
    answer: >
      Currently we only support <code>img</code> to <code>PDF</code> conversions
      (but more abilities are coming soon! Send us an <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">issue/PR</a> for any requests/fixes).
      Alchemy supports (virtually) any type of image format.

  - question: How do you use the app?
    answer: >
      Simply open the app by clicking on the menubar icon, or by hitting <code>⌘8</code>.
      Then just drag your image files in the box and you're done ☑️.
      Hope that is easier than what you are used to.

  - question: What technology is it built with?
    answer: >
      Alchemy is built entirely on <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>, and uses
      <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-tools.php" target="_blank" class="a-smart">Imagemagick</a>
      under the hood. Right now we require that you have Imagemagick installed in fact (this is soon to change!).
      We use <code><a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank" class="a-smart">webpack</a></code> for builds, and
      <code><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager" target="_blank" class="a-smart">electron-packager</a></code>
      for packaging Alchemy for OSX.

  - question: Whats next?
    answer: >
      In short, lots:<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/3" target="_blank" class="a-smart">1.</a> Install Imagemagick with Alchemy so you dont have to.<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/4" target="_blank" class="a-smart">2.</a> More output file types.<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/5" target="_blank" class="a-smart">3.</a> More input file types: video, code, <a target="_blank" class="a-smart" href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues">you tell us</a>!<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/dawnlabs/alchemy/issues/6" target="_blank" class="a-smart">4.</a> Smoother workflow: drop files from multiple folders, select output type, and display a link to open in the finder.
