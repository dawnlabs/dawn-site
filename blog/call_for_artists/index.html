faq:
  - question: What do you mean, `Call for Artists`?
    answer: >
      We want to work with artists, and support them in a world that may
      support them in every way except financially. Art plays a valuable
      role in our society, but the money does not always back up this claim.
      It is for this reason we offer reduced (or pro-bono) rates for artists
      in need of technical support.
  - question: What sort of projects?
    answer: >
      Although we would love to help artists with landing pages, branding,
      and other digital solutions, we don't have the bandwidth to take on
      everything. We think an ideal project includes an interactive element,
      something that we as developers can create custom solutions for.
      If you don't know if your project fits, please
