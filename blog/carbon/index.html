  - question: What problem does <a href="/carbon" class="a-smart" rel="Carbon">Carbon</a> solve?
    answer: >
      You know <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/890191815567175680">all</a> <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/reactjs/status/890511993261654017">of</a> <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/notquiteleo/status/873483329345028096">those</a> <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/thejameskyle/status/884986927954497536">code</a> <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/zeithq/status/805779711154647040">screenshots</a> you see on Twitter?
      Though the code's usually impressive, it seems like there's always something lacking in the aesthetic department.
      And we get itâ€”it's hard to justify spending the time to mess around with your editor/terminal enough to make it beautiful, all for a single tweet.

      Carbon solves this issue by making it super easy to create and share beautiful screenshots of your already beautiful code.
  - question: Why'd you make it?
    answer: >
      Inspired by the images of code in <a class="a-smart" href="https://twitter.com/notquiteleo/status/873483329345028096">Leo's Tweets</a>, we thought that "dev twitter" would be a lot easier to look at if the code images everyone shared looked even the slightest bit better.
  - question: How can I contribute?
